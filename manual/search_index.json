Platt 2020-09-24 Preface This book is a supplement to the book, Quantitative Social Science: An Introduction, by Kosuke Imai. It also relies heavily on the work of Jeffrey Arnold, who translated the Imai code into tidyverse code. I aspire for this text to act as a minimal manual for the course PSC 253 Scope and Methods in Political Science taught at Morehouse College. It is intended to cover all of the main analytical tasks that the course requires. "],
