That is X^y. # raise 43 to the power of 5 43 ^ 5 ## [1] 147008443 Take the square root of some number x by using the function sqrt(). That is sqrt(x). # take the square root of 43 sqrt(43) ## [1] 6.557439 1.1.3 Troubleshooting Keep in mind that R follows the order of operations, 2 + 2 * 2 is equal to 6 and not 8. # correct 2 + 2 * 2 ## [1] 6 # incorrect (2 + 2) * 2 ## [1] 8 "],

We will create vectors for a variety of reasons in this course. 1.3.1 Problem You want to create a vector. 1.3.2 Solution Use the function c() to create a list by separating the entries with a comma. # create a vector called &#39;prime&#39; prime &lt;- c(1, 3, 5, 7) prime ## [1] 1 3 5 7 # create a vector called &quot;first_name&quot; first_name &lt;- c(&quot;Matthew&quot;, &quot;Mosi&quot;, &quot;Manu&quot;, &quot;Ekundayo&quot;, &quot;Kwasi&quot;) first_name ## [1] &quot;Matthew&quot; &quot;Mosi&quot; &quot;Manu&quot; &quot;Ekundayo&quot; &quot;Kwasi&quot; 1.3.3 Troubleshooting As the name of a function, c() is case sensitive. Use the lowercase c. Make sure that all elements are separated by a comma. Vectors are typically assigned to some object. "]
