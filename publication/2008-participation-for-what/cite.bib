	abstract = {Abstract  Normatively and intuitively, we conceive of political participation as an integral component of democratic policymaking. However,
research on participation generally does not include policy considerations as part of individuals’ decisions to engage in
activism. I offer an opportunity model of participation that begins to study how policy goals shape individual participation
and how aggregate participation shapes policymaking. The central argument is that individuals’ policy goals allow them to
recognize those moments when it is most efficient and/or effective to take action. Examining black participation from 1980
to 1994, I show that black Americans are more likely to participate when they face external threats, are embedded in social
networks, and have greater access to policymakers. Most importantly, the recognition of these opportunities varies according
to individuals’ resources. This research moves beyond the discussion of who participates to address the equally fundamental
question: participation for what?},
